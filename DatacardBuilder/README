Running the SCRA2BLE datacard builder!  

Check out the package: 
> cmsrel CMSSW_7_1_5
> cd CMSSW_7_1_5/src/
> git clone git@github.com:nhanvtran/SCRA2BLE.git
> git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
> scram b -j8

> cd SCRA2BLE/DatacardBuilder
> # run it! here's an example
> python buildCards-AllBkgs.py -b --allBkgs --signal SMSqqqq1000 --tag myFirstTest --lumi 10.0 --mu 10.0

This will create a set of cards for you in a new directory.  
The options are as follows:

backgrounds to include, options are 
--allBkgs
--qcdOnly
--llpOnly
--zvvOnly
--tauOnly


'--signal': signal models, can be SMSqqqq1000, etc.
'--tag': for you to identify your cards, can be whatever string you want
'--lumi': so far only works for 10.0 and 3.0, default = 10.0
'--mu': injected signal strength, default = 1.0

-------------------------

After you get your cards, you may want to run some limits or significances. 

A script is here to aid you, although its quite straightforward and you could do it form the command line if you felt like it.
> python combineAllCards.py -b --run --dir  myDir

Here, 'myDir' is the directory where your cards went.  Right now the code runs the limit and significance.  It should not take more than a few minutes.
