Some instructions on how to run the cards (and not build them):

> cmsrel CMSSW_7_1_5
> cd CMSSW_7_1_5/src/
> git clone git@github.com:nhanvtran/SCRA2BLE.git
> git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
> scram b -j8

> cd SCRA2BLE/DatacardBuilder
> python combineAllCards.py -b --dir ../Cards/testCards-DrellYan2-SMSbbbb1000 --run

The directory is just the set of cards in the ../Cards directory you want to look at
N.B. Don't use the LowDPhi cards right now, they are non-sense
